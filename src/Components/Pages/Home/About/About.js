          We are a group of friends who dream of world filled with happiness. A
          world where everyonre's Dream come true. We are working on some
          projects that hopefully make at least some of the Unhappy faces Smile
          :). We have 10 members in our team who are very optimistic about
          future and kind hearted to the poor people. As our mission is to make
          the world a happier place for helpless people, we try our best to find
          out those who need help very badly and help them in everyway possible.
